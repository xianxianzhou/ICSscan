Transparently and accurately track cross-chain ICS-721 data within the Cosmos Ecosystem.

With the development of blockchain technology, new solutions have emerged for the trading and protection of digital artworks. Among them, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as representatives of digital assets have attracted tremendous attention in the market. However, the cross-chain transaction problem of NFTs has always been one of the hot topics in the industry.

 We will provide a detailed introduction to the entire process of NFTs from the initiating chain to the target chain and then to the transaction, and explore how to provide cross-chain information support for applications.

Firstly, the initiating chain of NFT refers to the blockchain network where NFTs are created, such as the IRIS network. On this network, users can create their own NFTs and conduct purchases and transactions. However, due to the isolation between different blockchain networks, the concept of the target chain needs to be introduced for cross-chain transactions of NFTs. The target chain refers to the blockchain network where users wish to trade their NFTs, such as the Uptick network.
